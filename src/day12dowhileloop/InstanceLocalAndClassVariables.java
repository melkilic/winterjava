	 	1)If a variable is created 
	 		a)inside the class but outside the main method and
	 		b)it is not "static"
	 	  then it is called "Instance(Object) Variable"
	 	Note: If you do not assign any value for an instance variable, Java assigns "0" for it, if the variable is a number
	 		  The values which Java assigns are called "default value"
	 		  
	    2)If a variable is created
	    	a)inside the class but outside the main method and
	 		b)it is "static"
	 	  then it is called "Class Variable"
	 	Note: The main differences between "static(class)" and "instance(object)" variables is that
	 			a)All updates on a static variable is visible by all objects which are created from the class but
	 			  all updates on an "instance variable" is visible just by the object
	 			b)"static variables" are common for all objects, but instance variables are specified for an object  
	 			
	    3) If a variable is created inside a method, it is called "local variable" 	
	       Note: For "local variables", there is no default value.
	             You have to assign value, when you create a local variable	
	       Note: "local variables" which are created in a "static method" are "static" automatically.
