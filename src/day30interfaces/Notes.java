	 * By using interface, we can use multiple inheritance in Java.
	 * Interface is not a class.
	 * 
	 * METHODS
	 * All methods in interface are public and abstract by default even if we don't write 'public abstract'.
	 * (Removing the access modifier in a class, it'll be default.)
	 * 
	 * VARIABLES
	 * All variables in an interface are public, static and final by default. Since variables are fianl, we need to initialize them.
